# StudyBuddy
A virtual study group assistant

## Inspiration

As the world is in the middle of a pandemic, students have become disconnected from each other, no longer can they study in the library together with classmates. We faced this challenge ourselves, entering our 1A term not knowing anyone and being estranged from our classmates having to study alone at our homes, but what if there was a way we could connect to each other?

## What it does 

UW Study Buddy matches Waterloo students with others based on their study habits and course they would like to improve on or generally study. It allows these matches to then join a video call and study together. The matching algorithm takes into consideration things like their study term, course they would like to focus on, timezone, study time and learning style. These traits help us find the best possible study buddy for you!

## How I built it

We built Study Buddy using Javascript for the backend development; HTML and CSS for the content and style of the frontend of our website. Our website was hosted on the GitHub platform and then pointed to our custom domain uwstudybuddy.online . JSON was used to format the incoming data allowing our matching algorithm work effectively. Our video chat rooms were build upon the Vonage Video API that allowed us to embed the video into our html.

## Challenges I ran into

The major challenge that we ran into was embedding the video chat API of Vonage into our html page.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We are proud that we were successfully able to implement our webapp and include the video chat API as well.

## What I learned

We are all beginner hackers so this was a big learning experience for all of us. We learnt new languages like JavaScript and delved deeper into others like HTML/CSS

## What's next for UW Study Buddy

We hope to optimize our matching algorithm by customising the quiz  so that students can find the most suitable buddy for themselves. We also look forward to making more chat rooms.
